Learning ðŸŽ“
==========

This project's primary audience is experienced cloud infrastructure folks looking to production-ize a modern Serverless stack in a single AWS account. But, it's also an appropriate place to learn the various parts along the way!

## Projects

We have **three** main reference projects from which to learn:

* [aws-lambda-serverless-reference](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference): (**This project!**) Our most basic Serverless reference with a full production infrastructure.
* [aws-lambda-dogs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-dogs): A simple REST API Serverless reference using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). If you don't need VPC or are unsure of where to begin, start here.
* [badges](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/badges): Our advanced reference project that includes more complex enhancements like: per-PR environments, github-flow support, promote-to-production artifacts, etc. Once you've mastered manual CF + TF + SLS deploys, come over here and see how far automation can take us!

## Getting Started

1. (_For Formidables only_). Contact Roemer to get three AWS IAM users. The `-developer` and `-admin` users will be manually attached to the appropriate `sandbox` stage groups (`tf-simple-reference-sandbox-developer`, `tf-simple-reference-sandbox-admin`) for use with `serverless` commands.
    1. `FIRST.LAST` user: An AWS superadmin that can do things like deploy the bootstrap CloudFormation and service Terraform infrastructures. This user reflects a DevOps lead in a client project. Should only be used for `yarn cf:*` and `yarn tf:*` commands.
    2. `FIRST.LAST-developer` user: A user with IAM group permissions for the specific serverless project + `STAGE` to update an existing deployment. This reflects an engineer on a client project with limited privileges or maybe a CI system for staging or whatnot. Should only be used for `yarn lambda:*` commands.
    3. `FIRST.LAST-admin` user: A user with IAM group permissions for the specific serverless project + `STAGE` to update + create/delete any deployment. This reflects an engineer on a client project with full privileges over the serverless application, but not the supporting cloud infrastructure. Should only be used for `yarn lambda:*` commands.

2. Then, follow all the basic directions for installation in the [README](./README.md).
    1. (_For Formidables only_). Please set up `aws-vault` per the instructions for your authentication method.

3. Check that your credentials are set up for all appropriate work:

    ```sh
    # 1. Check CloudFormation as superadmin
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST --no-session -- \
      yarn cf:bootstrap:status
    ...
    "UPDATE_COMPLETE" # (or some other status)

    # 2. Check Terraform as superadmin
    # 2.a. Init to appropriate stage backend.
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST --no-session -- \
      yarn tf:service:init --reconfigure
    ...
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!

    # 2.b. Run plan to see any changes from our code vs. actual infrastructure.
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST --no-session -- \
      yarn tf:service:plan
    ...
    No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

    # 3. Check Serverless as `-developer`
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST-developer --no-session -- \
      yarn lambda:info
    ...
    Service Information
    service: sls-simple-reference
    stage: sandbox
    region: us-east-1
    stack: sls-simple-reference-sandbox
    ...
    ```

## Exercises

### Environments

> `tl:dr`: use `sandbox` and only do `yarn lambda:*` commands for intro exercises.

**Lambda**

All of the introductory exercises are performed in the pre-existing `sandbox` environment using only `yarn lambda:*` commands to do serverless deployments as an `-admin` or `-developer` user. This means that you should just let folks know in an appropriate channel that you are "taking over" the environment.

**Infrastructure** (_CloudFormation + Terraform_)

Your superadmin user should be reserved only for work on _new_ environments. If you choose to do a new environment, it is _very important_ that you talk to Tyler or Roemer and refactor this application to grep and comment out all sections titled `OPTION` in `serverless.yml` and `terraform/main.tf` to remove all the extra bells and whistles (particularly VPC which is slow and complicates things) in a temporary branch to make your infrastructure work much easier and more focused.

### Lambda Exercises

1. Completely review and read the `README.md` one more time and ask questions in a slack channel!

1. Do a deployment of the serverless branch as-is off `master` branch:

    ```sh
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST-developer --no-session -- \
      yarn lambda:deploy
    ```

    ... then go and kick the tires on a URL!

    The endpoints created will be listed under `endpoints` in the console output.  Please note that the endpoints MUST end with `/`.  If the output is `https://ii178wi5hi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sandbox/base`, then you must use `https://ii178wi5hi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sandbox/base/` (notice the trailing `/`) in your browser.

1. Delete the serverless application and re-deploy it as-is off `master` branch:

    ```sh
    # Be careful!
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST-admin --no-session -- \
      yarn lambda:_delete

    # Now, the `lambda:deploy` command needs an `-admin` user to create.
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST-admin --no-session -- \
      yarn lambda:deploy
    ```

1. Create a temporary branch and edit something in `src/server/base.js` that will be visible from a public URL. Then deploy it and check the results!

    ```sh
    $ STAGE=sandbox aws-vault exec FIRST.LAST-developer --no-session -- \
      yarn lambda:deploy
    ```

1. See if there are any [open issues](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-serverless-reference/issues) that need just a serverless / application code fix and try to open a pull request! Or, be a saint and update all the root project dependencies in `package.json` to keep us up to date, verify everything still works, and open a pull request.

### Infrastructure Exercises

Once you've got the basics of serverless deployment down, you can head over to [aws-lambda-dogs Infrastructure Exercises](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/aws-lambda-dogs/blob/master/LEARNING.md#infrastructure-exercises) to do things with your AWS superadmin user to the infrastructure (without having to deal with a VPC).
